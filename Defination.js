---------
Higher-order functions are functions that take a function as an argument and/or return a function. 
We use them a lot in functional programming. 
They are a way to define reusable functionality, as we do with map, filter, and reduce.

example :sort, reduce, filter, forEach are other examples of higher-order functions built into the language.

------
Functional programming (also called FP) is a way of thinking about software construction by creating 
pure functions. It avoid concepts of shared state, mutable data observed in Object Oriented Programming. 
Functional langauges empazies on expressions and declarations rather than execution of statements.

Pure functions are functions that accept an input and returns a value without modifying any 
data outside its scope(Side Effects). Its output or return value must depend on the input/arguments 
and pure functions must return a value. ... Not only must pure function return a value but 
it must depend on the input.
