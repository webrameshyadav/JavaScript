Eclipse Keymap
this is an extension for developers like me who have coded in backed in eclipse IDE and they want to reuse those extension while doing front end development to in VSCode. This extension is a boon to them as all shortcuts like c s r will work here. for al the list u can see contribution section.

Tslint : 
An extension that i have covered in previous section where i have helped you in fixing code quality. it will help you in increasing your code readability, maintainability and rectify functionality errors.

Bracket pair colorizer:
This extension will help you in finding out as in where your bracket starts and ends so that you will not get confused in nested codes.  there is color combination as in yellow pink blue and it repeats which is completely configurable.

Auto import:
This extension gives u suggestions as soon as you start typing and clicking on any suggestion will auto import your component/service what so ever it is.

Angular Snippets :
This extension will completely change the way the code. as i always say coding is all about logic and not about syntaxes at all. so its time when we should focus on logic and give the task of remembering the syntaxes to this extension and i will show u how.

Angular2 Switcher :
This extension will help u navigate between css, ts and html files of a particular component. As in if we do two binding, property bindings we may need to create variables, use them in template and hence so many times we need to back and forth this extension is particularly for that.
Alt + u - html
Alt + I -  css
Alt +p - spec

Prettier
How so ever good ur code logic is good, if ur code is very untidy ur higher authorities will never approve ur code. And after doing a helll lot of coding making your code look good is tedious task isn't it. Can you image a scenario where u just code and save ur file and magic happens, all ur code is automatically structured correctly or else beautified. This is the power of this extension. 

Rest client:
as a front end or full stack developer we have to frequently hit some backend api to get or send some data through the http request. Rather than going to third party tools like postman we can actually do all those stuff here itself in vscode.

Json to TS:
while doing FE coding or working as a full stack developer , u will frequently come across scenarios where u have some API at backend and it return json objects and u need to cast them in response to so models or POJOs on front end then this extension is a boon to all of us. It will parse whole json and create pojos out of it.
